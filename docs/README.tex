\section{Contributions}
The entire class contributed equally on this project. We discussed the design and then split up the classes. Once we started the implementation there was a lot of communication to decide on how each peice of the Scanner should work. There was also a lot of collaboration deciding on what to put in our test files and debugging when the tests exposed flaws.

\section{Files Included}

\subsection{Header Files}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Symbol.h
	\item SymbolTable.h
	\item Token.h
	\item Scanner.h
	\item Administration.h
  \item Parser.h
  \item Grammar.h
  \item Types.h
  \item BlockTable.h
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Source Files}
\begin{itemize}
	\item plc.cc
	\item SymbolTable.cc
	\item Token.cc
	\item Scanner.cc
	\item Administration.cc
  \item Parser.cc
  \item BlockTable.cc
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Files}
\begin{itemize}
	\item search.pl - A full test program from the Brinch Hansen textbook.
  \item defs.pl - Test all of the defenition rules.
  \item simpleExps.pl - Tests all of the expression rules.
  \item errorTest.pl - Tests a number of different errors. Tries to ensure that the parser catches all errors and recovers to a stable state.
  \item fibDP.pl - A program to calculate fibonacci numbers from 0-10. Tests recursion and procedure parameters.
  \item typeErrors.pl - Check a few of the possible type errors.
  \item testNew.pl - Sets up some records and procedures with parameters.
\end{itemize}

\section{Compiling and Running}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Navigate into the project folder and type the following:

\verb|        \$ make compiler|

	\item This will create a binary called compiler that cna be run with the following command:

\verb|        \$ compiler <testfile-path> -o <output-file>|

	\item If you omit the \verb|-o <output-file>| flag the tokens will be output to a file called \verb|pl.out|
	\item If you add the \verb|-v| flag some debugging info will be printed. This will include each function that is called and matched tokens. This will not affect the output of tokens.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Bugs}
None. That we know about.


\section{Time Spent}
Hours spent on this project combine all group member contributions. Scanner 30 hrs. Parser 40 hours.
Rule additions and Scope and Type checking 30 hours.
