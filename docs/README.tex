\section{Contributions}
The entire class contributed equally on this project. We discussed the design and then split up the classes. Once we started the implementation there was a lot of communication to decide on how each peice of the Scanner should work. There was also a lot of collaboration deciding on what to put in our test files and debugging when the tests exposed flaws.

\section{Files Included}

\subsection{Header Files}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Symbol.h
	\item SymbolTable.h
	\item Token.h
	\item Scanner.h
	\item Administration.h
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Source Files}
\begin{itemize}
	\item plc.cc
	\item SymbolTable.cc
	\item Token.cc
	\item Scanner.cc
	\item Administration.cc
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Files}
\begin{itemize}
	\item fullTabTest.pl - Tests making the symbol table full
	\item keywordTest.pl - Tests each of the valid keywords
	\item maxNumTest.pl - Tests numbers and makes sure integer overflow is detected
	\item errorTest.pl - Tests other errors and Test that after 10 errors we quit execution
	\item scannerOfficialTest.pl - Test a PL program from the Brinch Hanson texbook
\end{itemize}

\section{Compiling and Running}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Navigate into the project folder and type the following:

\verb|        \$ make compiler|

	\item This will create a binary called compiler that cna be run with the following command:

\verb|        \$ compiler <testfile-path> -o <output-file>|

	\item If you omit the \verb|<output-file>| option the tokens will be output to a file called \verb|pl.out|
\end{enumerate}

\section{Bugs}
None. That we know about.
