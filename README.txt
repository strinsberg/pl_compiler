How to Compile the Compiler
  In order to compile our compiler the user is required to first make sure they are in the correct directory.
  Then simply type "make compiler" into the console.

How to Run the Compiler
  To run the compiler the user must type "compiler -o filename.out test/filename.pl" or "compiler test/filename.pl".
  In the case where the user typed "compiler -o filename.out test/filename.pl" the following applies:
            "filename.out" is the name of the file the user wants to output to, if a file of that name exists it will be overwritten otherwise a new file by that name is created
            "test/filename.pl" is the file that the user wants the compiler to read which is located in the test directory. If the user wants to test a file that is not in the test
              directory then they will need to add or copy the file to the test directory.


Is the Code Bug-Free
  Our comprehensive tests indicate that our code is bug free. Give it your best shot!

Approximate Time Spent Working
  The approximate amount of hours that were spent working on the compiler thus far is 25hours.
